# Badhbh Chatha
Sampling for the number of positions in chess. For the meantime this will only be an upperbound, but in time I'll (probably) introduce the ability to solve positions and therefore produce a probabalistic lowerbound as well.

## System Requirements
- There are currently certain architecture requirements for intrinsics :( !!
- GMP GNU multiple precision

## Project Name
Badhbh Chatha is the modern Irish for [Badb Catha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Badb) which is an Irish 'war goddess who takes the form of a crow'.
